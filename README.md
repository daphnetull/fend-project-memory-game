## Overview

This is my version of Project 2 for Udacity's front-end web development (FEND) nanodegree program.  It is a simple classic memory game where the user must successfully match all cards.  Cards that don't match will be revealed for 2 seconds to allow the user to memorize them.      

The initial design of the deck (minus the opening and closing modal windows) was provided as a starter set by the Udacity instructors, so this was mostly a JavaScript project.  

When time allows upon the completion of the nanodegree, I plan to go back and redesign it from scratch.

The starting files of index.html and app.css were forked from Udacity's fend-project-memory-game repo found here: https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game

The app.js was written by Daphne Tull, with the exception of the shuffle algorithm, which is based off the classic Fisher-Yates Shuffle: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2450954/how-to-randomize-shuffle-a-javascript-array/2450976#2450976
