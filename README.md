## Overview

This is my version of Project 2 for Udacity's front-end web development (FEND) nanodegree program.  It is a simple classic memory game where the user must successfully match all cards.  Cards that don't match will be revealed for 2 seconds to allow the user to memorize them.      

The initial design of the deck (minus the opening and closing modal windows) was provided as a starter set by the Udacity instructors, so this was mostly a JavaScript project.

When time allows upon the completion of the nanodegree, I plan to go back and redesign it from scratch.
